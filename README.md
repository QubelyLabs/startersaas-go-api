# Starter SaaS GO API

This project contains everything you need to setup a fully featured SaaS API in 5 minutes.
# Installation
Copy `.env.example` into `.env` and `stripe.conf.json.example` into `stripe.conf.json`.

Build the application

```bash
docker compose build
```

And finally, run the application

```bash
docker compose up
```


# Stripe setup

Configure your stripe webhooks by setting as "Endpoint URL" :

```
https://<my_startersaas_api_domain>/api/v1/stripe/webhook
```

and events below:

```
invoice.payment_succeeded
invoice.payment_failed
customer.subscription.created
customer.subscription.updated
```

Configure Stripe to retry failed payments for X days (https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/automatic Smart Retries section), and then cancel the subscription. 

Remember this value, it will be used in the `.env` file in `PAYMENT_FAILED_RETRY_DAYS` variable.

# Configuring stripe.conf.json

In this file you have to add the stripe API public key, in the `publicKey` field

Then for every product you want to sell, copy it's price_id (usually starts with price_xxx) and paste it in the "id" key.

```
{
  "id": "price_xyz",
  "title": "Starter - Piano Mensile",
  "price": 199,
  "currency": "EUR",
  "features": [
    "Piano editoriale mensile",
    "1 post Facebook/settimana",
    "1 post Instagram/settimana",
    "1 Facebook story/settimana",
    "1 Instagram story/settimana",
    "1 articolo il blog ottimizzato SEO",
    "-",
    "-",
    "-",
    "-"
  ],
  "monthly": true
}
```

Then sets its title, its price (in cents, the same you have configured in Stripe) and the list of features you want to show in the frontend pricing table. 

Finally set `"monthly":true` if your plan is billed on monthly basis, otherwise we consider it billed yearly.
